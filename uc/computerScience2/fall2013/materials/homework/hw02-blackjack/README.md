Homework 2 - Blackjack
======================

See homework 2 on http://uc.cascadelms.org for the full description

Summary
-------

Write a program that plays a single hand of blackjack between a human player (the user of your program) and the dealer. The rules for the dealer are set, so no need to think about artificial intelligence.

We will use the “rules for play at casinos” found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Rules_of_play_at_casinos

If the dealer gets 21 with the first 2 cards, the dealer wins. Unless the player also has 21 with their first 2 cards, then this is a push (tie).

If the player hasn’t busted (gone over 21), the dealer will draw cards until they have a hand total of 17 or higher.

The player with the highest card total that is 21 or under, wins.
