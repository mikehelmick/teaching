Teaching Materials
==================

Open source teaching materials from my time in academics. I was a visiting faculty member at Miami University (Oxford, Ohio) from Fall 2005 through Fall 2007 and a teacing track faculty member at the University of Cincinnati from Fall 2013 through Spring 2014. Since I am transitioning back to industry, I have decided to open source all of my teaching materials.
