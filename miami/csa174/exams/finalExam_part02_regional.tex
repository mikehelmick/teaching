\section*{Programming Questions}

\question[11] The {\tt StringUtils} class is incomplete, complete these methods.
\begin{parts}
 \part The method {\tt swapFirstAndLast} should swap the first and last elements of the {\tt String} array argument.  If the array was fewer than two (2) elements, it should do nothing.  Write the code for this method:
 \part The method {\tt randomWordOfTheDay} should return a random word in the array.   It should be possible to obtain any of the words in the array.   If the {\tt wordList} is empty, return {\tt ""}.
\end{parts}

\begin{verbatim}
import java.util.Random;
public class StringUtils {
    public static void swapFirstAndLast( String[] words ) {
\end{verbatim}

\begin{solution}[2in]
\end{solution}

\begin{verbatim}		
    } 
	
    public static String randomWordOfTheDay( String[] wordList ) {
\end{verbatim}

\begin{solution}[2.5in]
\end{solution}

\begin{verbatim}	
    }	
}	
\end{verbatim}

\question[12] Suppose that a Car class has been defined.  One of its methods is {\tt getMileage()} which returns an {\tt int} indicating the number of miles the {\tt Car} has been driven.  Another {\tt Car} method is a {\tt void} method named {\tt setPrice()} whose only parameter is a {\tt double}, indicating the price at which that car should be sold.  Suppose that {\tt parkingLot} is an two-dimensional array of {\tt Cars} that has already been declared and filled with {\tt Car} objects.
\par
Write code below that will set the price of all cars in {\tt parkingLot}  as follows: If the car’s mileage is below 10,000, the price should be \$10,000.  Cars whose mileage is at least 10,000, but less than 50,000 should have a price of \$8,000.  All other cars should be sold for \$5,000.

\begin{verbatim}
public class CarDealer {

    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        Car[][] parkingLot = PlaceWhereCarsComeFrom.getCarArray();
        // BEGIN ANSWER
\end{verbatim}

\begin{solution}[4.5in]
\end{solution}

\begin{verbatim}
        // END ANSWER
    }
}	
\end{verbatim}
 
\newpage

\question[13] Complete the following Java class as specified.  The {\tt Person} class represents a person, some information about them, and their location on the map.   The {\tt Location} class is defined here.
\begin{lstlisting}
public class Location {
	private int x_pos;
	private int y_pos;
	
	public Location( int x, int y ) {
		x_pos = x;
		y_pos = y;
	}
	
	public void setX( int x ) {
		x_pos = x;
	}
	
	public void setY( int y ) {
		y_pos = y;
	}
}	
\end{lstlisting}

The {\tt Person} class is defined starting here, you will need to refer to the Location class for some of the methods.   Look for the word {\bf TODO} to indicate methods that need to be completed
 
\begin{verbatim}
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age; 
    private Location location;

    // TODO: write the person constructor that initialize all of the fields
    public Person( String name, int age, int xLoc, int yLoc ) {
        // BEGIN ANSWER
\end{verbatim}
\begin{solution}[2in]
	
\end{solution}
\begin{verbatim}
        // END ANSWER
    }
\end{verbatim}
\newpage

\begin{verbatim}
	// TODO: Create a constructor that initializes the person's name and age
	// The location should be set to a default of (5,5)
    public Person( String name, int age ) {
        // BEGIN ANSWER
\end{verbatim}
\begin{solution}[2in]	
\end{solution}

\begin{verbatim}
        // END ANSWER
    }

    // TODO: return the distance of this person (their locaiton)
    // to the origin (0,0)
\end{verbatim}
\hspace{.4in}Distance formula: $\sqrt{ (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 }$
\begin{verbatim}
    public double distanceToOrigin() {
       // BEGIN ANSWER
\end{verbatim}
\begin{solution}[3in]
\end{solution}

\begin{verbatim}
        // END ANSWER
    }

}
\end{verbatim}

\question[14] An integer array can be used to store the population of cities arranged on a stretch of highway. Cities are considered crowded if: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It and its immediate neighbor have a total population of 10 or more (for the two cities on the end).  If the city is on the end, then this is the population of the city, plus the population of the only city bordering it.
	\item It and its immediate neighbors have a total population of 15 or more (for the cities in the interior).   A city's population, plus the population of the city to the left and to the right.
\end{enumerate}
\par Write the body of the method below that accepts an integer array (length $>=$ 2), representing the population of a series of cities, and returns a boolean array indicating whether each city is considered crowded. For example, the following integer array represents the population of 9 cities. 

\par Example:
\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=6in]{finalExam_progQuestion_4}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\par Place your answer on the next page...

\newpage
\begin{verbatim}
public class Population {
    
    public static boolean[] crowded( int[] population ) {	
\end{verbatim}

\begin{solution}[6in]
\end{solution}

\begin{verbatim}
    }

}	
\end{verbatim}

\question[5] A Niven number is a number that is exactly divisible by the sum of its digits.   The first 9 integers are obviously divisible by themselves.   After that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 10 is a Niven number: $1 + 0 = 1 \rightarrow$, 10 is divisible by 1
	\item 11 is NOT a Niven number: $1 + 1 = 2 \rightarrow$, 11 is not divisible by 2
	\item 12 is a Niven number: $1 + 2 = 3 \rightarrow$, 12 is divisible by 3
\end{itemize}
For reference, here are the Niven numbers through 40 \newline
{\tt 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 20, 21, 24, 27, 30, 36, 40} \newline

\par
Write a static method called {\tt isNiven()} that takes in an {\tt int} value and returns a {\tt boolean}, indicating if the number passed in is a Niven number or not.  

\begin{verbatim}
public class NumberMethods {
    // BEGIN ANSWER
\end{verbatim}

\begin{solution}[5in]
\end{solution}

\begin{verbatim}
    // END ANSWER
}	
\end{verbatim}
