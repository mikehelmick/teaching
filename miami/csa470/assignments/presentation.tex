\section{Project Description}
For your final project you are to investigate an open source framework that can be used in the development of enterprise Java applications (or possibly another language).   You will give a 15 minute presentation, providing an overview of the technology/framework, its uses, example projects, how it relates to the material covered in class, and any other relevant information you care to share.
\par
Any PowerPoint (or other files) should be uploaded to the course Web site by the assigned due date.  

\section{Possible Frameworks}
Here are some frameworks that I consider worthy of being studied, this is not a complete list and you may choose other frameworks if you so desire.   Email me with your preferred framework - each framework can only be covered once, so decide early.    

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Struts (Web Presentation)
	\item Tapestry (Web Presentation)
	\item Spring Framework (Integration/Service Layer Framework)
	\item Hibernate (Data Mapping) 
	\item Pico/Nano Container (Inversion of Control)
	\item HiveMind (Service Layer Framework)
	\item AspectJ (Aspect Oriented Programming)
	\item Trails (Web/Service/Data Mapping)
\end{enumerate}
